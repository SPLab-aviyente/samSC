# samSC
MATLAB implementation of Strength Adjusted Multilayer Spectral Clustering [1]. A demonstration for the usage of the method is given in the script named `demo_ml_lfr`, where one of the simulations in the paper is performed. Further details about how to employ the method can be found by `help sam_sc`.
